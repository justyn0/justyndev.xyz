I like to go a little bit in-depth on the high res Pistol I made for the TF2 Awesome Pack back in February. This mostly goes a little in-depth with the texture techniques I used while making this.

First I'll have to make the mesh a bit hi-res. So I have a better time with baking textures and have a chance to simplify the UVs so it's easier to paint on.

Then I went ahead and bake 2 texture maps for the mesh. A ambient occlusion map and a world normal map. These 2 texture maps will help out a lot for creating some lighting and shadows within the texture quickly.

At this step I usually put down the basic colors that I need and use the 2 texture maps I mentioned previously to have a general look on how I wanted the texture would be lit. For the world normal map, I extracted the green channel so I could have lighting above the mesh

Then I started to paint! You don't really need any fancy brushes for this case. I just use multiple variants of the same default soft/hard round brush in Photoshop!

And here it is! After some time of painting in details, lighting, and shadows while looking at the original TF2 Pistol as reference. The texture is done! As a bonus, on the right you can see the swatches I used while painting this texture!

And finally we can take look how this pistol looks like in-game! I'm quite proud how this turned out and matches fairly closely to the look of the TF2 Pistol as seen on release day!
