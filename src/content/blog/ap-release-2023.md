Hello! Today I will like to share what I have been working and what is planned for the TF2 Awesome Pack in the future.

First off 2 new class textures are coming! Spy and Heavy!

I've had a lot of fun working on these two. Especially now when I have a bit more experience with texturing and the PSDs for these two are a whole lot cleaner and rganized compared to the other classes I've done in the past.

Speaking of the classes I've done in the past. I'm planning to improve their textures more as well making the layers more organized and easier to edit.

I also have been experimenting on adding/changing existing particles. So far I tweaked the metal impact particles for bullet impacts and wrench hits. They're still n work in progress, but so far I'm liking it!

Now for answering the title of this post. The answer is soon! hopefully! For sure the next release will come out before this year ends.

This release is taking a while since I've been busy and setting up stuff for the public github repository and soon a gamebanana page.

The best way to get updated on this project is following this account and checking out the [public repository](https://github.com/justyn0/TF2-Awesome-Pack).
