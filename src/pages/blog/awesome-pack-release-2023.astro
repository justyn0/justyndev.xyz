				<p>Hello! Today I will like to share what I have been working and what is planned for the TF2 Awesome Pack in the future.</p>

				<p>First off 2 new class textures are coming! Spy and Heavy!</p>

				<p>I've had a lot of fun working on these two. Especially now when I have a bit more experience with texturing and the PSDs for these two are a whole lot cleaner and organized compared to the other classes I've done in the past.</p>

				<p>Speaking of the classes I've done in the past. I'm planning to improve their textures more as well making the layers more organized and easier to edit.</p>

				<p>I also have been experimenting on adding/changing existing particles. So far I tweaked the metal impact particles for bullet impacts and wrench hits. They're still in work in progress, but so far I'm liking it!</p>

				<p>Now for answering the title of this post. The answer is soon! hopefully! For sure the next release will come out before this year ends.</p>

				<p>This release is taking a while since I've been busy and setting up stuff for the public github repository and soon a gamebanana page.</p>

				<p>The best way to get updated on this project is following this account and checking out the <a href="https://github.com/justyn0/TF2-Awesome-Pack">public repository</a>.</p>
